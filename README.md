/*JAVA TASK ONE- SIMPLE CALCULATOR WITH ADVANCE FEATURES.*/

Simple Calculator Documentation:


Introduction:

This document provides an overview of a simple calculator application built in Java. The calculator allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, exponentiation, and modulo. It features a graphical user interface (GUI) developed using Java's Swing library.


Functionality:

-User Interface: The GUI features a text field for input and buttons for numeric digits, arithmetic operations, and special functionalities.

-Arithmetic Operations: Users can input arithmetic expressions and perform calculations by clicking the corresponding buttons.

-Handling User Input: Action listeners handle button clicks and perform the corresponding actions, appending input from numeric buttons to the text field.

-Result Display: The result of calculations is displayed in the text field after clicking the "equals" button. Users can clear the input field with the "CLR" button.


Code Implementation:

-Implemented in Java using Swing library for GUI.
-Action listeners manage user interactions and perform arithmetic operations.
-Conditional statements determine the operation based on the selected button.
-Mathematical operations are carried out using built-in Java functions.


Conclusion:

The simple calculator application provides users with a basic tool for performing arithmetic calculations through an intuitive graphical interface. It showcases fundamental concepts of event-driven programming and demonstrates the capabilities of Java's Swing library.
