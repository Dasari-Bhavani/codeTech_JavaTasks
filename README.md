/*JAVA TASK ONE- SIMPLE CALCULATOR WITH ADVANCE FEATURES.*/

Simple Calculator Documentation:


Introduction:

This document provides an overview of a simple calculator application built in Java. The calculator allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, exponentiation, and modulo. It features a graphical user interface (GUI) developed using Java's Swing library.


Functionality:

-User Interface: The GUI features a text field for input and buttons for numeric digits, arithmetic operations, and special functionalities.

-Arithmetic Operations: Users can input arithmetic expressions and perform calculations by clicking the corresponding buttons.

-Handling User Input: Action listeners handle button clicks and perform the corresponding actions, appending input from numeric buttons to the text field.

-Result Display: The result of calculations is displayed in the text field after clicking the "equals" button. Users can clear the input field with the "CLR" button.


Code Implementation:

-Implemented in Java using Swing library for GUI.
-Action listeners manage user interactions and perform arithmetic operations.
-Conditional statements determine the operation based on the selected button.
-Mathematical operations are carried out using built-in Java functions.


Conclusion:

The simple calculator application provides users with a basic tool for performing arithmetic calculations through an intuitive graphical interface. It showcases fundamental concepts of event-driven programming and demonstrates the capabilities of Java's Swing library.





/*JAVA TASK TWO SIMPLE JAVA CHATBOT*/

ChatBot Documentation:

Introduction:

I have developed a ChatBot application using Java integrated with a Swing-based graphical user interface (GUI). Its primary purpose is to engage in conversations with users, providing responses based on predefined replies tailored to the context of their inquiries or statements.


Overview:

The ChatBot features a user interface comprising a chat window, a text input field, and a submit button.It formulates responses by analyzing and interpreting the content of user input, thereby tailoring its replies to the specific messages conveyed by users.


How It Works:

User Interface:
- I've set it up so user can type in the text box and click "SUBMIT" to send their message.
- The ChatBot replies in the chat window, showing if the message is from you or the ChatBot.

What It Can Do:
- It knows how to say hello, give information about itself, recommend a book, talk about its gender, respond to love or hate, and say goodbye.
- If you say something it doesn't understand, it'll let you know.

How I Did It:
- I used Java with Swing for the graphical part.
- I wrote code to check what users type and decide how to reply.
- Messages are shown in the chat window using JTextArea.


Conclusion:

The ChatBot allows users to have casual conversations. It's a fun way to see how computers can understand and reply to our messages.
